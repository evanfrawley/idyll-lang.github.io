# Getting Started

If you just want to quickly try out Idyll, we offer an [online editor](https://idyll-lang.github.io/editor/) where you
can play around and try out the language.


## Quickstart

To install and use Idyll locally, install it using `npm`. If you don't have `npm` installed, first install it by following
[these instructions](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

```sh
$ npm install -g idyll
```

Once the installation has finished, the `idyll` command will be available in your shell. To compile a file run `$ idyll <input-file>`, this will compile and open the resulting webpage in your browser.

## Project generator

If you are working on a more in-depth project, we provide a project
generator to help set with the initial configuration.
It will help get you set up using custom components, datasets, and stylesheets.
To use the generator:

```sh
$ npm install -g yo generator-idyll
$ yo idyll
```

The generator will produce a structure that looks like this:

```sh
$  tree -I node_modules
.
├── _index.html
├── components
│   ├── custom-component.js
│   └── default
│       ├── styles
│       │   └── ... default component stylesheets
│       └── ... default components in here
├── data
│   └── example-data.json
├── images
│   └── idyll.png
├── index.idl
├── package.json
└── styles.css
```

The files do the following:

* `index.idl` - The main Idyll file, write your text in here.
* `styles.css` - By putting CSS in here you can override the default styles.
* `components/` - The folder for custom components. Any component defined in this folder can be invoked in the .idl file.
* `data/` - If you want to include a dataset in your project, put it in here.
* `images/` - A folder for static images.
* `_index.html` - A barebones HTML file that will be used if you publish your project to the web.
* `package.json` - This file contains all the metadata for your project.

To get started, from a terminal in that directory run `npm start` and Idyll will compile your
file and open it in your web browser. Every time you save the `index.idl` file, the system will automatically recompile
everything and update the page in the browser.

The `components/default/` folder contains the default components that Idyll provides. If you need to directly
update one of these components or their styles, feel free - Idyll is built to be customized.

If you want to configure the paths or build steps that Idyll uses, open `package.json` and update the `scripts` section. These options are discussed in greater detail later on in the documentation.
