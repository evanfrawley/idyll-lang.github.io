# Building your Idyll project for the web

Once you are happy with your project, the `idyll` command-line tool can also be used to
build a stand alone bundle. If you used the Idyll project generator, npm tasks
to build and deploy the project to github pages are available.

## GitHub pages

Once you've initialized your
project with a repo on github, run the command

```sh
$ npm run deploy
```

this will compile the assets and push it to github
pages. Note that the [meta component](https://idyll-lang.github.io/components-built-in#meta)
is useful for inserting metadata into the compiled output.

## Other hosting

Idyll's generated output is compatible with other static hosting services as well.

To compile the project, run

```sh
$ npm run build
```

this will compile files and place them inside of the `build/` folder.
