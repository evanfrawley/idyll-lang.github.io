The main repository for Idyll is here: https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll. Feel free to 
open issues or create pull requests. 

The code for the Idyll compiler is here: https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll-compiler. If you are
having problems with the compiler, please submit an issue there.

There is also a publicly accessible chatroom on Gitter if you'd like to say "Hi!" or 
ask a quick question.

Contributions are welcome! If you want to start working on anything in particular, it's a good idea to
post in the chatroom, or a post comment or an issue on GitHub so that multiple people aren't trying to fix the same thing. Feel 
free to reach out to me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/mathisonian) or via email, idyll at mathisonian dot com.
