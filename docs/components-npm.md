# Installing components from NPM

## Overview

Because Idyll is built on top of React, any React component can
be used in Idyll. If you install a component using `npm`, Idyll
will automatically be able to find it without any additional configuration.

For example:

```
$ npm install some-react-component
```

This could then be used in your markup as

```
[SomeReactComponent /]
```
