# Gitter

There is a [public chatroom on Gitter](https://gitter.im/idyll-lang/Lobby) if you'd like to say "Hi!" or
ask a quick question.

Contributions are welcome! If you want to start working on anything in particular, it's a good idea to
post in the chatroom, or a post comment or an issue on GitHub so that multiple people aren't trying to fix the same thing. Feel
free to reach out to me [on twitter](https://twitter.com/mathisonian) or via email, idyll at mathisonian dot com.
